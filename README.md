# Custom_market_making_stratergy
This repository contains a custom market-making strategy script built using Hummingbot's ScriptStrategyBase. The strategy adjusts order spread and size dynamically based on real-time volatility and trend indicators. This also sets the buy and sell order according to the inventory skew.
